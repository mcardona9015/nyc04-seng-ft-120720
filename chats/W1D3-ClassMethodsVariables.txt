14:04:20	 From Josh Frank : @@confusing
14:07:02	 From Josh Frank : Git init
14:07:04	 From Josh Frank : Then git pull
14:20:10	 From Jordan Carroll : creating a getting for breed
14:20:10	 From Josh Frank : They‚Äôre allowing us to get and set
14:20:20	 From Josh Frank : Does .initialize count as an instance method?
14:21:50	 From Simon Jacobs : ^ same question
14:22:01	 From Jonathan Brinson : ^
14:22:02	 From Josh Frank : Thanks to shmuly for asking this great question in our breakout room
14:28:05	 From darien bryant : Its not mentioned because its hard coded?
14:28:14	 From darien bryant : ‚ÄúNumber of legs‚Äù
14:28:51	 From Josh Frank : It‚Äôs not a parameter because we‚Äôre hopefully not going to be cutting off dog legs
14:28:56	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Its not in the attr_ macros because the developer did not want the user to be able to call the number_of_legs variable or to change it
14:29:00	 From Josh Frank : ^
14:29:12	 From darien bryant : Thanks Danny!
14:33:39	 From madiwa simon : Its hardcode
14:36:10	 From Josh Frank : It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs an instance variable?
14:36:18	 From Lauren Gifford : instance variables were initialized so are always accessible
14:36:22	 From Simon Jacobs : Yeah that‚Äôs where my head is at ^
14:36:31	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : The attr_ macros only affect our ability to read it directly or change it
14:36:39	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Danny n simon
14:36:40	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : It doesn‚Äôt mean the variable doesn‚Äôt exist if it is already defined
14:36:59	 From madiwa simon : okay thank you guys
14:37:44	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : "self is a special variable that points to the object/class that "owns" the currently executing code."
14:41:26	 From madiwa simon : inception
14:41:34	 From Josh Frank : inception.pry
14:41:35	 From menachemmargolis : lol
14:41:42	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Does time change within each pry too?
14:42:22	 From madiwa simon : Will have to be inside to know
14:53:21	 From Josh Frank : So like‚Ä¶ if we had a City class, and an instance of that class called nyc‚Ä¶ nyc.mayor might return ‚ÄúBill de Blasio‚Äù while City.mayor might return a general description of all mayors
14:53:32	 From Josh Frank : That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at :/
14:53:40	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : yes
14:53:44	 From Josh Frank : OK cool
14:53:46	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Danny
14:54:23	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Like you could use a class method to return an array or count of how many users Twitter has, while each user is an instance
14:54:31	 From Josh Frank : Cool!
14:54:34	 From Josh Frank : Thanks Danny
15:02:01	 From Jennifer Tracy : Thank you Danny good question
15:13:17	 From madiwa simon : How do you do the short cut to select all the same name inside the program again I forgot cmd + ‚Äú?‚Äù?

15:13:43	 From madiwa simon : Oh thank you John
15:13:47	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : CMD + D for Mac
15:13:48	 From Josh Frank : Shift command L
15:14:07	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : ^ That selects all instance
15:14:08	 From madiwa simon : thank you thank you
15:14:11	 From Josh Frank : Of course
15:14:17	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : Cmd + D selects next instance of same thing

15:14:36	 From Josh Frank : My bad
15:15:02	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : I didn‚Äôt know about shift command L, that‚Äôs helpful

15:15:04	 From Josh Frank : Isn‚Äôt there also a way to define a consonant with a $?
15:15:08	 From Josh Frank : $CONSTANT
15:15:19	 From Josh Frank : Lol sorry *constant not consonant
15:15:23	 From Danny Sasse (he/him) : $ is global variable outside of classes
